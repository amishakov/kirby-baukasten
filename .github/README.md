# Kirby Baukasten

An opinionated, supercharged version of the Kirby Plainkit used internally at Love & Kindness for our clients' sites, with preconfigured tooling and plugins.

If you're not interested in all of my frontend opinions, you can use [composerkit](https://github.com/getkirby/composerkit/tree/main), which is essentially a simpler version with *only* Composer and the public & data folder setup.

> [!NOTE]
> While Kirby Baukasten is open source & used in production as base for my own projects, it's not properly versioned, and I'm not offering support for it. Instead, it should serve as a reference or guide for implementing certain best practices in your own starterkit.

## Requirements

- PHP 8.4+ with composer
- Node.js 24+ with pnpm

## Usage

##### Install Composer & Node dependencies with `composer install` and `pnpm install`.

```
composer install && pnpm install
```

##### Start the dev server.

```
pnpm run dev
```
