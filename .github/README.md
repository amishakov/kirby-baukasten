# Kirby Baukasten

An opinionated, supercharged version of the Kirby Plainkit used internally at [Love & Kindness](https://andkindness.com) for our clients' sites, with preconfigured tooling and plugins.

If you're not interested in all of my frontend opinions, you can use [composerkit](https://github.com/getkirby/composerkit/tree/main), which is essentially a simpler version with _only_ Composer and the public & data folder setup.

> [!NOTE]
> While Kirby Baukasten is open source & used in production as base for my own projects, it's not properly versioned, and I'm not offering support for it. Instead, it should serve as a reference or guide for implementing certain best practices in your own starterkit.

## Requirements

- [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/)

## Usage

1. Install the project tools and dependencies

```sh
mise install
mise run setup
```

This installs PHP 8.5.9 with Composer, the Kirby CLI, Node.js 24, pnpm 11.20.0, and the project dependencies. It also creates `.env` from `.env.example` if the file does not exist.

2. Configure the environment file

```sh
$EDITOR .env
```

3. Create required pages

```sh
mkdir -p data/storage/content/0_home && printf 'Title: Home\n\n----\n\nUuid: home\n' > data/storage/content/0_home/home.de.txt
mkdir -p data/storage/content/images && printf 'Uuid: images\n' > data/storage/content/images/images.de.txt
mkdir -p data/storage/content/error && printf 'Title: Seite nicht gefunden\n\n----\n\nUuid: error\n' > data/storage/content/error/error.de.txt

# optional
mkdir -p data/storage/content/files && printf 'Uuid: files\n' > data/storage/content/files/files.de.txt
```

4. Start the dev server.

```sh
pnpm run dev
```
